Conducted a comprehensive analysis on the impact of COVID-19 on the US job market utilizing Python tools including Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, GridSearchCV, and Streamlit. 
This project involved the analysis of datasets comprising over 1 million data points, aimed at identifying key trends and patterns such as sectors hit hardest by job losses, 
demographic impacts, and the rise of new job trends across the United States pre and post-pandemic. 
Leveraging Machine Learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression, I was able to predict job loss and identify job trends with an average 
accuracy of 87%, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's profound effect on employment landscapes.
